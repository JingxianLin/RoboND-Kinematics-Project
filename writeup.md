**Steps to complete the project:**  


1. Set up your ROS Workspace.
2. Download or clone the [project repository](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Kinematics-Project) into the ***src*** directory of your ROS Workspace.  
3. Experiment with the forward_kinematics environment and get familiar with the robot.
4. Launch in [demo mode](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd209/parts/7b2fd2d7-e181-401e-977a-6158c77bf816/modules/8855de3f-2897-46c3-a805-628b5ecf045b/lessons/91d017b1-4493-4522-ad52-04a74a01094c/concepts/ae64bb91-e8c4-44c9-adbe-798e8f688193).
5. Perform Kinematic Analysis for the robot following the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/972/view).
6. Fill in the `IK_server.py` with your Inverse Kinematics code.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/972/view) Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  

You're reading it!

### Kinematic Analysis
#### 1. Run the forward_kinematics demo and evaluate the kr210.urdf.xacro file to perform kinematic analysis of Kuka KR210 robot and derive its DH parameters.

A DH parameter table includes twist angle, link length, link offset, joint angle for each link, as shown below.  These DH parameters are derived by evaluating the kr210.urdf.xacro file and based on the information found in KR210 Forward Kinematics sections 1-3 in the classroom, for example, a1-3 can be directly read from lines 329-49 in kr210.urdf.xacro, and the position of the wrist center can be obtained using link_5.  An annotated figure of forward kinematics is provided with the table to get a better understanding.

Links | alpha(i-1) | a(i-1) | d(i) | q(i)
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
0->1 | 0 | 0 | 0.75 | q1
1->2 | -pi/2 | 0.35 | 0 | -pi/2 + q2
2->3 | 0 | 1.25 | 0 | q3
3->4 | -pi/2 | -0.054 | 1.5 | q4
4->5 |  pi/2 | 0 | 0 | q5
5->6 | -pi/2 | 0 | 0 | q6
6->EE | 0 | 0 | 0.303 | 0

#### 2. Using the DH parameter table you derived earlier, create individual transformation matrices about each joint. In addition, also generate a generalized homogeneous transform between base_link and gripper_link using only end-effector(gripper) pose.

Individual transformation matrices can be easily generated by defining the following 4x4 matrix (based on four individual transforms, T(i - 1,i) = R(x(i - 1),alpha(i - 1))*T(x(i - 1),a(i - 1))*R(z(i),q(i))*T(z(i),d(i)), describing the relative translation and orientation of link(i - 1) to link(i)):

    |     |     |
--- | --- | --- | ---
cos(q) | -sin(q) | 0 | a
sin(q)*cos(alpha) | cos(q)*cos(alpha) | -sin(alpha) | -sin(alpha)*d
sin(q)*sin(alpha) | cos(q)*sin(alpha) |  cos(alpha) |  cos(alpha)*d
0 | 0 | 0 | 1

then substituting the above table for each joint, for instance, the transformation matrix from base_link to link_1 and that from link_1 to link_2 are as follows:

T0_1 = TF_Matrix(alpha0, a0, d1, q1).subs(DH_Table)

T1_2 = TF_Matrix(alpha1, a1, d2, q2).subs(DH_Table)

By multiplying T0_1, T1_2, T2_3, T3_4, T4_5, T5_6, T6_EE together, the homogeneous transform between base_link and gripper_link is generated.

#### 3. Decouple Inverse Kinematics problem into Inverse Position Kinematics and inverse Orientation Kinematics; doing so derive the equations to calculate all individual joint angles.

And this is the hardest part of this project.  Based on the information found in Inverse Kinematics with Kuka KR210 session in the classroom, theta angles are calculated using Geometric IK method.  The derivation of theta1 is pretty straightforward, from the position of the wrist center, theta1 = atan2(WC(y), WC(x)); from the following image,

### Project Implementation

#### 1. Fill in the `IK_server.py` file with properly commented python code for calculating Inverse Kinematics based on previously performed Kinematic Analysis. Your code must guide the robot to successfully complete 8/10 pick and place cycles. Briefly discuss the code you implemented and your results. 


Here I'll talk about the code, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the implementation might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
